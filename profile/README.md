# Toystory imagnination in your hand 🌈👋

## Overview

- Toystory is a flutter application which helps children to make their own 3d model or toy using their imagination.

## How it works
- Step1. If a child speak or draw something on a mobile phone or tablet, the speech or drawing is converted to a text using SpeechToText or ImagetoText
- Step2. The app generates an image based on the previous text(prompt) by using Dall-E 3 api.
- Step3. Toystory app converts the previous 2d image(.png) to a 3d model(.obj,.glb)
- Step4. Children can play with the 3d model or print a real toy by using 3d printer.
