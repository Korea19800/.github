## How it works
- Step1. If a child speak or draw something on a mobile phone or tablet, the speech or drawing is converted to a text using SpeechToText or ImagetoText

- Step2. The app generates an image based on the previous text(prompt) by using Dall-E 3 api.

- Step3. Toystory app converts the previous 2d image(.png) to a 3d model(.obj,.glb) using TripoSR which leverages LRM(Large Reconstruction Model)

- Step4. Children can play with the 3d model content or print a real toy by using 3d printer.
